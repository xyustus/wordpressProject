## short Description
It was created a child theme unite-child where there are some basic source files for the theme works like functions.php and and styles.css. The custom post type and custom taxonomies were created using a plugin, it could be developed, but there are free plugin out there that get the job done. The custom fields were added in the moment of the creation of the film post. To overwrite a post template it was created single-film.php where the content can be organized for the visualization of a single post. In this file were added the custom taxonomies and fileds to visulaize in a film post. It could have been overwritten the content file for a more detailed and customized design. For listing all films showing some metadata it were used hooks, actions and filters...(loop_start,the_post) and added like a plugin to wordpress (plugins/details-cpt.php). For the shortcode it was developed shortcode_posts.php and setted below the search field using wordpress widgets.

## A sql dump from the database was done and stored in the root folder as backup.sql.
